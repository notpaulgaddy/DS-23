ALGORITHM ANALYSIS:
What's the order notation of your algorithm?

O((n^2) * (8^m))
n^2 represents the number of cells in the grid
8^m represents the number of possible directions that the algorithm can search in

TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?

MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

I've included screenshots of it working in replit but for some reason test cases 4 and 1 aren't working locally. I don't understand why this is or how to fix it. 
Once again, I have screenshots of both side by side so you know I'm not lying.
Im not able to upload screenshots because they take up too much space but here's my replit link, https://replit.com/@PaulGaddy/Hw6#tc1.txt, even better way for you to make sure i'm not lying

Puzzle 5 finds more matches than there are which is wrong, but I should still get partial credit for it

Thank you for your understanding
