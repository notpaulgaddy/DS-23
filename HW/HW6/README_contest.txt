HOMEWORK 6 CONTEST: INVERSE WORD SEARCH


NAME:  < Paul Gaddy >


OPTIMIZATIONS:
What did you do?

I changed some of the functions to interative instead of having full recursive to save runtime
Made my search and redo functions more effecient by checking for matches in a simpler way + using copy and reverse

TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?
