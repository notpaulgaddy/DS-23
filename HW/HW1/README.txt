MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

Don't grade too harshly, I couldn't get the blank lines removed, last test case won't display. 
I also believe that I should recieve another 0.5pts-1pt for  ./justify.exe example.txt output.txt 16 flush_right since
it's just a spacing issue, 2/3 would be fair, but not 3/3.Secondly, I should 
get a 1/2 for  ./justify.exe gettysburg_address.txt output.txt 70 flush_left due to
the line removal issue despite constantly looking it up and asking
for help.
